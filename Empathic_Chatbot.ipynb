    "           \"2.Reach out to the people\":\"Do things outside the home that include other people,For example, pick something that generally interests you, like a book club. “You’ll be surprised how quickly a community forms.\",\n",
    "           \"3.Spend time in nature.\":\"Experience the outdoors with all five of your senses,Pay attention to what you see, feel, hear, smell and possibly taste in nature, and it may help you out of your slump.According to a study,spending just 17 minutes per day)exploring your local park or walking around your neighborhood can greatly enhance your overall sense of well-being.\",\n",
    "           \"4.Get to know yourself\":\"Sometimes the best thing to do when we’re sad is to go inwards and stop avoiding the sadness.Sit yourself down with some coffee or tea, a notebook, and have a conversation with yourself.Concentrate on self growth\",\n",
    "           \"5.Do something you've always wanted to do\":\"Be a little adventurous.Is there something you’ve wanted to do lately or some place you’ve always wanted to go but never made the time to go there? Well, now’s your chance to do it! Experiencing something new is a great way to put the sadness behind you and put life into a new perspective. Go on an adventure!\",\n",
    "           \"6.Write about what you love about yourself\":\"When you’re sad, it can be really helpful to write a list about everything you love about yourself.Remind yourself of these things everyday while building onto that list. Recognize the good – and remember what an amazing person you are, no matter what may be happening to you right now. You are amazing.\"}\n",
    "depressed_activities={\"1.Call a friend/family member\":\"Depression can tempt you to isolate yourself and withdraw from your friends and family, but face-to-face time can help wash away those tendencies.Try to remind yourself these people care about you.

    "                     \"3.Take a long shower\":\"You know what,Due to the skin’s high density of nerve receptors cold showers are considered to be somewhat a way to send electrical impulses from nerve ending to the brain leading to relief from symptoms of depression. Moreso, cold water natural helps the body to produce endorphins into the blood stream and brain that lifts our mood.So come on just go for it\",\n",

    "                      \"7.Try something new entirely\":\"It is one of the best choice you can ever make. When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain.
